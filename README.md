# Handwritten Digit Classification with Keras and TensorFlow

What the Project Does
Data Utilization: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels.
Model Building: Constructs a neural network model using Keras. The model includes layers such as convolutional layers, activation functions, and dense layers to process and classify the images.
Training and Evaluation: Trains the model on the MNIST training dataset and evaluates its performance on the test dataset to measure accuracy.
Performance Optimization: Implements techniques to enhance the modelâ€™s performance, such as adjusting hyperparameters and using dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
Results: Achieves high accuracy in digit classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of the neural network in recognizing and categorizing handwritten digits.
